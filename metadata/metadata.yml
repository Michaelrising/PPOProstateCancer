description: The evolution of drug resistance leads to treatment failure and tumor
  progression. Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy (IADT) helps responsive cancer
  cells compete with resistant cancer cells in intratumoral competition. However,
  conventional IADT is population-based, ignoring the heterogeneous phenotypes of
  individual patients. To address this challenge, we aim to develop a novel data-driven
  and patient-specific computational model to characterize the heterogeneity of the
  evolution mechanism for optimized drug administration policy.
